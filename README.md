The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and computer vision has enabled automated 
classification of objects in images. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can 
classify objects as organic or recyclable based on their visual characteristics. The system utilizes deep
learning techniques to extract features and differentiate between organic (e.g., fruits, plants, food
waste) and recyclable (e.g., plastic, metal, electronic devices) objects.
The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, leveraging a 
dataset containing labeled organic and recyclable objects. The model is trained using TensorFlow and
Keras, and pre-processing techniques such as image augmentation and normalization are applied to 
enhance accuracy.
Thissystem has applications in waste management, automated sorting, and environmental sustainability, 
where distinguishing between organic and recyclable waste can facilitate recycling efforts. Future
enhancements may involve expanding the dataset, integrating real-time image recognition, and 
deploying the model in embedded systems.

In today's world, automated classification of waste materials and objects is essential for 
environmental conservation and industrial automation. Traditional waste segregation relies on 
manual sorting, which is inefficient and prone to errors. A machine learning-based
classification model can significantly streamline waste management processes and improve 
recycling efficiency.
This project aims to develop a computer vision-based classification system that can identify whether
anobject in an image is organic or recyclable. The system will use a deep learning approach,
specifically a CNN model, trained on a dataset of various organic and recyclable items. The model
will be able to process input images and predict the category of the object with high accuracy.
 Describe the type of system being developed.
The proposed system is an AI-powered classification model that takes an input image and predicts 
trained on labeled datasets to performthe classification task.
